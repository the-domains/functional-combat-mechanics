## **TRAINING SESSIONS AND WHY WE ARE DIFFERENT**

### **Why come and train with us**

Functional Combat Mechanics is different to most wing chun clubs out there as we have spent time really looking at the Ving Tsun system and how it can be improved / trained for modern times.

Keys areas of development are Balance, Leverage, Targeting, Striking, Movement.

These are all developed through a module based coaching system.

Each Module builds on the previous and all neatly link together to make you grow into a very well rounded martial artist that is comfortable at all ranges.

All well as learning and progressing through the modules you will also learn the foundation and all traditional empty hand forms / weapons.

We also cover Dan Chi Sau / Lop Sau and Chi Sau or Connected Partner Training but these are applied and trained in a results based way.

Sriking to the pads with movement is also a big part of your development plan and Pad flows help to develop the key areas.
